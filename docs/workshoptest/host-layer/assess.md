# Identifying and Remediating Host Vulnerabilities - Host Layer Round - Assess Phase

!!! info "Important note!"
    __We are testing out some new ideas here.  Some things may not work as expected.  We appreciate your patience.__

In the previous Build Phase, you deployed a CloudFormation stack that contains
some Amazon EC2 instances behind an application load balancer.
You are now going to learn about AWS Inspector.
AWS Inspector assesses the instances and identifies security findings that can be remediated.

To save time, the CloudFormation teamplate will run an initial Inspector assessment
for you.  In later phases of the workshop, you will apply patches using AWS Systems Manager
and then run another Inspector assessment to see if there is any change in the number
of findings.

Before you can assess the instances with Amazon Inspector, you need to identify
the instances that you want to assess.
In small environments, you can select the instance IDs from a list but in environments
with hundreds or thousands of instance, you need an easier way to select them.
For this reason, you are going to learn how to use *tags* to select the instances on which you will install the Amazon Inspector agent.
Tags are labels that can be attached to AWS resources to make it easier to
act on them collectively.

In this section you will do the following tasks:

1. Examine the CloudFormation stack you built to learn about the tags that were applied by AWS CloudFormation.
3. Learn about Amazon Inspector targets, templates, and rules packages.
4. Examine Amazon Inspector findings

## Examine the stack that you built and its tags

1. Go to the CloudFormation console in the same AWS region where the stack was created..  You should see a list of stacks similar to the figure below. Locate the stack you created.  In this documentation, the name of the stack is *pww*.  If you are doing this workshop at an AWS event, the stackname may be much longer.  Make sure you can se the entire stack name.  Copy the stack name into a scratch file on your workstation in case you need it later.

    ![cloudformation-stack-list](./images/assess-cloudformation-stacks.png)

2. Click the **check box** to the left of the stack name and then click the **Resources** tab below.  You will see a list of resources that were deployed by the stack as shown in the figure below.

    ![cloudformation-stack-resources](./images/assess-cloudformation-resources.png)

    The *Type* column lists the type of the resouces.  Notice that you will not see any resources of type AWS::EC2::Instance even though there are now EC2 instances running..  The reason for this is that the CloudFormation stack did not deploy any - at least not directly.  The stack did, however, deploy an auto scaling group with a launch configuration that in turn launched the instances.  You will now look at the auto scaling group and see how it supports tagging.

3.  Continue scrolling through the resources shown by CloudFormation and look for a resource named *AutoScalingGroup* as shown in the picture below.


    ![CloudFormation Auto Scaling Group](./images/assess-cloudformation-asg.png)

    Click the hyperlink next to AutoScalingGroup.  This will take you to the Amazon EC2 console and display the auto scaling group.  Click on the *Tags* tab to see how the auto scaling group handles tags.  Your console display should look similar to the picture below.

    ![EC2 Auto Scaling Group](./images/assess-ec2asg.png)

    The picture above shows that there are four tags that are propogated to every EC2 instance created by the auto scaling group.  The tags include a *Name* tag and three additional tags that are generated by CloudFormation.  This tells us that every EC2instance that is launched by the auto scaling group will have a Name tag with the value of *pww-node*.

    In a production environment, you may have a large number of resources that spin up and spin down because of the elastiicity that AWS offers.  If you understand how tags are applied you can more easily manage the environment regardless of how many instances exist at any point in time. You will now learn how to look up the Amazon EC2 instances using tags.


4.  Go to the Amazon EC2 console and look for instances having a name that begins with the stack name followed by *-node*, *pww-node* in this example.  If you cannot see them, type the instance name (*pww-node* in this case) into the search box.  Select one of them by checking the box to the left of the instance and then click on the *Tags* tab.  You should see a table like that in the figure below.

    ![ec2-instance-list](./images/assess-ec2-instance-list.png)

5.  Notice that the instance has tags reflecting the CloudFormation stack name and stack id.  These tags are added because of settings in the auto scaling group which propogate tags to newly created instances.

    You have now learned about the tags that you can use to look up AWS resources.  You will now learn how tags can be used within Amazon Inspector to select the instances that will be assessed.

## Explore Amazon Inspector

### Understanding Amazon Inspector targets

1. Go to the Amazon Inspector console.

2. Click **Assessment Targets** on the left menu.  Assessment targets represent a group of EC2 instances that Inspector will assess.  You will see a target whose name begins with *InspectorTarget*.  Click on the arrow widget to open the target and display the details.  You should see something similar to the image below.

    ![Amazon Inspector Targets](./images/assess-inspector-view-targets.png)

    In the figure above, notice that the *Use Tags* section contains a key/value pair with the entries *aws:cloudformation:stack-name* and *pww* respectively.  This Inspector target is configured to select all instances that were started by the CloudFormation stack.

3. Click the **Preview Target** button.  A new window opens as shown below.

    ![Amazon Inspector Targets](./images/assess-inspector-preview-targets.png)

    You now see there are three Instances that Inspector will assess based on the configuration of the target.

4. Click the **Assessment Templates** on the left menu.  A list of assessment templates appears as shown below.

    ![Amazon Inspector Targets](./images/assess-inspector-view-templates.png)

    You will see an assement template whose name begins with *AssessmentTemplate*.  Assessment templates reprsent the selection of a target and one or more rules packages.  A rules package is a collection of rules that represent security checks.   This template assesses the previously mentioned target against the following two rules packages:

    Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures: The rules in this package help verify whether the EC2 instances in your assessment targets are exposed to common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs). Attacks can exploit unpatched vulnerabilities to compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of your service or data. The CVE system provides a reference method for publicly known information security vulnerabilities and exposures. For more information, see [https://cve.mitre.org/](https://cve.mitre.org/){target=_blank}.  You typically remediate findings from this rules package by installing patches.

    Security Best Practices: The rules in this package help determine whether your systems are configured securely.  For example, one rule in this package checks to see if root login has been disabled over ssh.  You typically remediate the findings by adjusting configuration settings.

5. In the *Use Tags* section, select **aws:cloudformation:stack-name** for the key from the drop down list and select the name of the stack (*pww* in this example) from the drop down value list.

5. Uncheck the *Install Agents* check box since we have already installed the agent. Your screen should look similar to the figure below.

    ![inspector-targets](./images/assess-inspector-targets.png)

6.  Click the **Save** button to save the target definition.  Inspector may prompt you for permission to create a service linked role to give the Amazon Inspector service permission to retrieve information about your instances.  If you see a prompt like the one in the figure below, click **Ok** to create the role.

    ![inspector-service-role](./images/assess-inspector-slr.png)

    You have now created an Amazon Inspector target that identifies the instances that would be assessed.  The target selects instances based on tag values.  In this case, the tag you are using is *aws:cloudformation:stack-name* which is set to the name of the CloudFormation stack.  In particular, the tag is added to the auto scaling launch configuration which is configured to propogate the tag to the Amazon EC2 instances that it launches.  Because of this, Amazon Inspector will automatically scan new instances that may appear over the lifetime of the environment.  This is an example of how the elasticity of the AWS cloud when combined with tagging can enable you to support dynamic environments.

### Configure the Amazon Inspector template and run the assessment

Now that you have created an Amazon Inspector target, you will now create an Amazon Inspector tepmlate.  You use templates to define the Amazon Inspector targets and rule packages that comprise an assessment run.

1.  Go to the Amazon Inspector console, click **Assessment templates** on the menu, and then click **Create**.

2.  In the *Name* field, enter a name for the template.

3.  In the *Target name* field, select the target you previously created from the list of options.

4.  In the *Rules packages* field, select **Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures** and **Security Best Practices**.

5.   In the *Duration* field, select **15 minutes**.  Do **not** accept the default value!

6.  In the Assessment Schedule, uncheck (turn off) the *Set up recurring assessment* runs so that the assessment template will only run a one-time assessment.

7.  Scroll to the bottom and click the **Create and run** button to save the template and run the assessment.  Depending on the size of your screen, you may have to scroll down multiple windows.  If you cannot click **Create and run**, make sure you unchecked the box in the previous step and try again.  The assessment will start and will take 15 minutes to compete.

8.  On the Amazon Inspector menu, click **Assessment runs**.  You should see an entry for the assesment you just started.  While the assessment is running, the status will be *Collecting data*.  Periodically refresh the screen to see the current status.  When the assessment run ends, the status will change to *Analysis complete.*  The assessment will run for approximately 15 minutes.   While you are waiting, continue with the steps below.

### Learn more about Amazon Inspector Rules Packages

1.  Amazon Inspector offers a variety of rules packages that can be included in assessments.  The applicable rules packages may vary by operating system.   The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures assessment is based on the CVE project that is hosted at [cve.mitrei.org](https://cve.mitre.org).  Open a new tab in your browser to [cve.mitre.orf](https://cve.mitre.org).  Click on **Search CVE List**.  Enter **CVE-2018-20169** into the search field and click **Submit**.  This shows you how to research known vulnerabilities.

2.  The Security Best Practices rule package examines some common configuration settings for some of the most commobn Amazon Linux settings.   You can read more about this rule package [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/inspector/latest/userguide/inspector_security-best-practices.html).

### Examine the findings

1. After the assessment run has completed, go to the Amazon Inspector console and click **Assessment runs**.  The window should be similar to what appears below.

    ![assessment-runs](./images/assess-inspector-runs.png)

2. On the line that represents your most recent run, make note of the number in the *Findings* column (22 in this diagram).  After you perform the remediation later in this workshop, that number should decrease.   Click on the number in the *Findings* column.  The findings associated with the run will appear as shown below.

    ![assessment-findings](./images/assess-inspector-findings.png)

3.  You will see findings for each of the rules packages that you used in the assessment.  The number of findings often varies by the age of the AMI (Amazon Machine Image) because older AMIs typically have more vulnerabilities than newer AMIs.  Choose one of the findings associated with the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures rule package.  An example appears below.

    ![assessment-cve-example](./images/assess-inspector-cve.png)

    Note that there is a link in the recommendation on which you can click to see the CVE entry.

4.  Now that you have run the assessment and seen the findings you are ready to perform some remediation.
