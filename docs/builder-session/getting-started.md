# Getting Started

## Create or Identify Exisitng AWS account

In order to complete these workshops, you'll need a valid, usable <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/" target="_blank">AWS Account</a>. Use a personal account or create a new AWS account to ensure you have the necessary access and that you do not accidentally modify corporate resources. Do **not** use an AWS account from the company you work for.
