!!! info "Note About Workshop and AWS Account"
    <p style="font-size:16px;">
    _If you are not using an AWS account provided by the Workshop Team, we **stronly recommend that you use a non-production AWS account for this workshop** such as a training, sandbox or personal account. If multiple participants are sharing a single account you should use unique names for the stack set and resources created in the console._

If you are using your own account or an account provided by the Workshop Team, proceed with CloudFormation deployment in the preferred AWS region below:

1. Click ***Next*** on the Specify Template section.

2. On the Specify stack details step, update the following parameters depending on how you are doing this workshop:

- If you are sharing an AWS account with someone else in the same region, change the name of the stack to __pww-yourinitials__
- Trusted Network CIDR: Enter a trusted IP or CIDR range you will access the site from using a web browser. You can optain your current IP at <a href="https://ifconfig.co/" target="_blank">Ifconfig.co</a> The entry should follow CIDR notation. i.e. 10.10.10.10/32 for a single host.
- Keep the defaults for the rest of the parameters.

3. Click ***Next***

4. Click Next on the ***Configure stack options*** section.

5. Finally, acknowledge that the template will create IAM roles under Capabilities and click **Create**.

This will bring you back to the CloudFormation console. You can refresh the page to see the stack starting to create. Before moving on, make sure the stack is in a __CREATE_COMPLETE__ status. This should take ~8 minutes.
