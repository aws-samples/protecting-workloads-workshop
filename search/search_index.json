You are now going to learn about AWS Inspector. AWS Inspector assesses the instances and identifies security findings that you will later remediate. Explore Amazon Inspector You are now going to learn about AWS Inspector terms and explore the Inspector console. Understanding Amazon Inspector targets Go to the Amazon Inspector console. Click Assessment Targets on the left menu. Assessment targets represent a group of EC2 instances that Inspector will assess. You will see a target whose name begins with InspectorTarget . Click on the arrow widget to open the target and display the details. You should see something similar to the image below. In the figure above, notice that the Use Tags section contains a key/value pair with the entries aws:cloudformation:stack-name and pww respectively. If you are at an AWS event, your stack name will be something like \"mod-\" and be followed by some additional characters. This means that this Inspector target is configured to select all instances that are related to the CloudFormation stack with the given stack name. Tags are labels. They are very helpful when you are working with variable numbers of instances. Rather than specifying individual instance ids, you can select the instances with a specific tag and then do operations on that grgroup. In the case of instances behind a load balancer, you may not know the instance IDs, but if they all share a tag then you can work on them collectively by tag. Click the Preview Target button. A new window opens as shown below. You now see there are three Instances that Inspector will assess based on the configuration of the target. Click the Assessment Templates on the left menu. A list of assessment templates appears as shown below. You will see an assement template whose name begins with AssessmentTemplate . Assessment templates represent the selection of a target and one or more rules packages. A rules package is a collection of rules that represent security checks. This template assesses the previously mentioned target against the following two rules packages: Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures: The rules in this package help verify whether the EC2 instances in your assessment targets are exposed to common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs). Attacks can exploit unpatched vulnerabilities to compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of your service or data. The CVE system provides a reference method for publicly known information security vulnerabilities and exposures. For more information, see https://cve.mitre.org/ {target=_blank}. You typically remediate findings from this rules package by installing patches. Security Best Practices: The rules in this package help determine whether your systems are configured securely. For example, one rule in this package checks to see if root login has been disabled over ssh. You typically remediate the findings by adjusting configuration settings. On the Amazon Inspector menu, click Assessment runs . You should see an entry for an assesment that was started on your behalf. CloudFormation ran this for you to save time. If the status is not, Analysis complete, then periodically refresh the screen until the status changes to Analysis complete as shown in the figure below. On the line that represents your most recent run, make note of the number in the Findings column (117 in this diagram). After you perform the remediation later in this workshop, that number should decrease. Click on the number in the Findings column. The findings associated with the run will appear as shown below. You will see one of the findings has been expanded to reveal more details. The middle section of the finding has been removed to save space. Now that you have learned about Inspector assessments, you are ready to perform some remediation using AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager. You will then run an Inspector assessment yourself to see if the number of findings has changed.

In the case of instances behind a load balancer, you may not know the instance IDs, but if they all share a tag then you can work on them collectively by tag. Click the Preview Target button. A new window opens as shown below. You now see there are three Instances that Inspector will assess based on the configuration of the target. Click the Assessment Templates on the left menu. A list of assessment templates appears as shown below. You will see an assement template whose name begins with AssessmentTemplate . Assessment templates represent the selection of a target and one or more rules packages. A rules package is a collection of rules that represent security checks. This template assesses the previously mentioned target against the following two rules packages: Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures: The rules in this package help verify whether the EC2 instances in your assessment targets are exposed to common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs). Attacks can exploit unpatched vulnerabilities to compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of your service or data. The CVE system provides a reference method for publicly known information security vulnerabilities and exposures. For more information, see https://cve.mitre.org/ {target=_blank}. You typically remediate findings from this rules package by installing patches. Security Best Practices: The rules in this package help determine whether your systems are configured securely. For example, one rule in this package checks to see if root login has been disabled over ssh. You typically remediate the findings by adjusting configuration settings. On the Amazon Inspector menu, click Assessment runs . You should see an entry for an assesment that was started on your behalf. CloudFormation ran this for you to save time. If the status is not, Analysis complete, then periodically refresh the screen until the status changes to Analysis complete as shown in the figure below. On the line that represents your most recent run, make note of the number in the Findings column (117 in this diagram). After you perform the remediation later in this workshop, that number should decrease. Click on the number in the Findings column. The findings associated with the run will appear as shown below. You will see one of the findings has been expanded to reveal more details. The middle section of the finding has been removed to save space. Now that you have learned about Inspector assessments, you are ready to perform some remediation using AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager. You will then run an Inspector assessment yourself to see if the number of findings has changed. Click here to proceed to the Remediate Phase.","title":"Understanding Amazon Inspector targets"},{"location":"workshop/host-layer/contribute/","text":"Contributing Guidelines Thank you for your interest in contributing to our project.

Attention Please ensure you are using the improved AWS WAF console and API experience for this workshop. Website Scanning Environment and Tools In order to test your AWS WAF ruleset, this lab has been configured with two scanning capabilities; a Red Team Host where you can invoke manual scanning and an automated scanner which runs from outside your lab environment. The scanner performs 10 basic tests designed to help simulate and mitigate common web attack vectors. Canary GET - Should not be blocked Canary POST - Should not be blocked SQL Injection (SQLi) in Query String SQL Injection (SQLi) in Cookie Cross Site Scripting (XSS) in Query String Cross Site Scripting (XSS) in Body Inclusion in Modules Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Token Missing Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Token Invalid Path Traversal Workshop Architecture Note about Tests These basic tests are designed to provide common examples you can use to test AWS WAF functionality. You should perform thorough analysis and testing when implementing rules into your production environments. Website Scanning Environment and Tools - Manual Scanning Once you have started a Session Manager connection to your Red Team Host, the scanner script can be invoked by typing the following command: runscanner The scanner script will run each of the tests above and report back the following information: Request : The HTTP request command used. Test Name : The name of the test from list above. Result : The HTTP status code returned. The logic in the scanner script color codes the response as follows: Green : 403 - Forbidden ( Except for canary GET and POST tests. ) Red : 200 - OK Blue : 404 - Not Found Yellow : 500 - Internal Server Error About Scanner Tests and Colors The color coding of the tests is provided to help to quickly assess the behavior of your WAF rules againsty their intended behavior. The goal is to acheive green color responses for all the tests. The purpose of the canary GET and POST requests are to ensure you have not unintentionally blocked legitimate traffic to your test site. These two tests should always return a 200 - OK response. What are the results of running the scanner script? Were the simulated malicious requests blocked? As you can see by running the script there are several vulnerabilities that need to be addressed. In the remediate phase you will configure an AWS WAF Web ACL to block these requests. When AWS WAF blocks a web request based on the conditions that you specify, it returns HTTP status code 403 (Forbidden). For a full view of the request and response information, you can paste the Request command directly into the console and add the --debug argument. Note about Testing Tool The scanner script uses an open source HTTP client called httpie .

Website Scanning Environment and Tools - Automated Scanning For an AWS sponsored event, in addition to the manual scanning, automated scanning is also performed against your lab website. The automated tests are similar to the manual tests but the results are posted to a centralized scanning results dashboard along with the other workshop participants.

You are now going to design and implement an AWS WAF ruleset to help mitigate these vulnerabilities. In this section you will do the following tasks: Identify the WAF ACL for your site AWS WAF Rule design and considerations Console Walkthrough - Creating a Rule WAF Rule Creation and Solutions Attention Please ensure you are using the improved AWS WAF console and API experience for this workshop. Identify the WAF ACL for your Site If needed, go to https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home . You will be redirected to the AWS Management Console dashboard on successful login: Make sure you select the appropriate AWS Region when working in the AWS Management Console (top right corner, on the menu bar). From the Management Console dashboard, navigate to the AWS WAF & Shield service console. You can do that several ways: Type \u201cwaf\u201d in the AWS services panel search box and select the resulting option Expand the Services drop down menu (top left on the menu bar) and choose WAF & Shield Expand the All services area of the AWS services panel and choose WAF & Shield Once selected, you will be redirected to the AWS WAF & AWS Shield service console. You may see an initial landing page at first. Choose Go to AWS WAF: 3. In the side bar menu on the left, pick the Web ACLs option under the AWS WAF heading. If the list of Web ACLs appears empty select the correct AWS Region as indicated on your credentials card in the Filter dropdown IN THE Web ACLs area of the window . If you are sharing the same account with other participants you can identify your WAF ACL by the Id in the stack outputs in the region where the stack was launched. 4. Click on the WAF Web ACL Name to select the existing Web ACL. Once the detail pane is loaded on the left of your screen, you will see three tabs: Requests, Rules, and Logging. Toggle to Rules: Validate that you are able to see a pre-existing rule, configured to block requests, and that your Web ACL is associated with an Application load balancer resource. You can drill down further into the properties of the existing rule, by selecting the rule name and clicking Edit . This rule references IP sets for the loopback/localhost IP addresses (127.0.0.0/8, ::1/128). Viewing and Logging Requests In the Overview tab for your Web ACL, you can view a sample of the requests that have been inspected by the WAF. For each sampled request, you can view detailed data about the request, such as the originating IP address and the headers included in the request. You also can view which rule the request matched, and whether the rule is configured to allow or block requests. You can refer to the sampled requests throughout this exercise to monitor activity and look for suspicious activity. Although not used in this workshop, in the Logging and metrics tab, you can enable full logging to get detailed information about traffic that is analyzed by your web ACL. AWS WAF Rule Design and Considerations Basics You use AWS WAF to control how an Amazon CloudFront distribution, an Amazon API Gateway API, or an Application Load Balancer responds to web requests. Web ACLs \u2013 You use a web access control list (ACL) to protect a set of AWS resources. You create a web ACL and define its protection strategy by adding rules. Rules define criteria for inspecting web requests and specify how to handle requests that match the criteria. You set a default action for the web ACL that indicates whether to block or allow through those requests that pass the rules inspections. Rules \u2013 Each rule contains a statement that defines the inspection criteria, and an action to take if a web request meets the criteria. When a web request meets the criteria, that's a match. You can use rules to block matching requests or to allow matching requests through. You can also use rules just to count matching requests. Rules groups \u2013 You can use rules individually or in reusable rule groups. AWS Managed Rules and AWS Marketplace sellers provide managed rule groups for your use. You can also define your own rule groups. Rule statements are the part of a rule that tells AWS WAF how to inspect a web request. When AWS WAF finds the inspection criteria in a web request, we say that the web request matches the statement. Every rule statement specifies what to look for and how, according to the statement type. Every rule in AWS WAF has a single top-level rule statement, which can contain other statements. Rule statements can be very simple. For example, you could have a statement that provides just a set of originating countries to check your web requests for. Rule statements can also be very complex. For example, you could have a statement that combines many other statements with logical AND, OR, and NOT statements. How WAF Works After you create your web ACL, you can associate it with one or more AWS resources. The resource types that you can protect using AWS WAF web ACLs are Amazon CloudFront distributions, Amazon API Gateway APIs, and Application Load Balancers. Note About This Section In order to illustrate the process of creating WAF rules, we will walk through the creation of the first rule in your WAF ACL. The complete list of threats and solutions is available in the WAF Rule Creation and Solutions section. Rule Design Considerations: Use the following guiding questions when planning WAF rules: What is the intended purpose of the rule? What HTTP request components apply to the purpose of the rule? Do you already have rules or rule groups targeting those request components that you can expand? Is that desirable? How can you define the purpose of the rule in a Boolean logic expression? Will the rule require nested statements under logical AND or OR rule statements? Are any transformations relevant to my input content type? Sample Rule purpose: Detect SQL Injection in query string, use \u2018block\u2019 action in Web ACL HTTP request components: Request Method \u2013 form input typically gets submitted using a GET HTTP request method Query String \u2013 the SQL injection attempt is located in the query string Define the purpose of the rule using Boolean logic: If Query String contains suspected SQL Injection then block Sample Rule - Statement to implement: Contains SQL injection attacks Match type targeting the request Query string Relevant transformations: Contains SQL injection attacks Match type query string is URL encoded, so we will apply the URL_DECODE transformation. Rules to implement: Rule with 1 predicate Contains SQL injection attacks Match type Console Walkthrough - Creating a Rule In the AWS WAF console, create a SQL injection rule by clicking the Web ACL, Add rules , Add my own rules and rule groups Click on Rule builder , provide matchSQLi for the Name and keep Regular rule for Type : 3. For If a request select matches the statement . Under Statement , for Insepect select Query string , for Match type select Contains SQL injection attacks , for Text transformation select URL decode and for Action select Block . 4. Click on Add Rule and then click Save View the matchSQLi rule in the Rule visual editor to confirm it is correct. Additional Resources For a more comprehensive discussion of common vulnerabilities for web applications, as well as how to mitigate them using AWS WAF, and other AWS services, please refer to the Use AWS WAF to Mitigate OWASP\u2019s Top 10 Web Application Vulnerabilities whitepaper . WAF Rule Creation and Solutions In this phase, we will have a set of 6 exercises walking you through the process of building a basic mitigation rule set for common vulnerabilities. We will build these rules from scratch, so you can gain familiarity with the AWS WAF programming model and you can then write rules specific to your applications. Note About Exercise Solutions For the exercises below, you will find the high level description and solution configuration for your web ACL. You can test your ACL ruleset at any time using the Red Team Host. For AWS sponsored event, you can also view test results on the WAF Lab Dashboard . 1. SQL Injection & Cross Site Scripting Mitigation Use the SQL injection, cross-site scripting, as well as string and regex matching to build rules that mitigate injection attacks and cross site scripting attacks. Consider the following: How does your web application accept end-user input (whether directly or indirectly). Which HTTP request components does that input get inserted into? What kind of content encoding considerations do you need to factor in for the input format? What considerations do you need to account for in regards to false positives? For example, does your application legitimately need to accept SQL statements as input? How do the requirements derived from the above questions affect your solution? SQL Injection Solution Update the matchSQLi rule with 2 additional statements Select the matchSQLi rule and click Edit ( You should have created this rule in the walk through above ) Change If a request to matches at least one of the statements (OR) Click Add another statement : body, contains sql injection attacks, html entity decode and URL decode Click Add another statement : header, cookie, contains sql injection attacks, url decode View the existing matchSQLi rule to confirm additional condtions Re-run the WAF test script (runscanner) from your red team host to confirm requests are blocked Rule JSON editor Thus far you have used the Visual Rule Editor to create WAF Rules but every web ACL also has a JSON format representation. In there, you see these special types of rule statements. For rules of any complexity, managing your web ACL using the JSON editor is the easiest way to go. You can retrieve the complete configuration for a web ACL in JSON format, modify it as you need, and then provide it through the console, API, or CLI. AWS WAF supports nesting of rule statements. To combine rule statement results, you nest the statements under logical AND or OR rule statements. The visual editor on the console supports one level of rule statement nesting, which works for many needs. To nest more levels, you can edit the JSON representation of the rule on the console. Cross Site Scripting Solution Create a new rule named matchXSS and for If a request choose matches at least one of the statements (OR) . Add statements: all query parameters, contains xss injection attacks, url decode body, contains xss injection attacks, html enity decode body, contains xss injection attacks, url decode header, cookie ( type manually ), contains xss injection attacks, url decode Click on Add Rule and then click Save Click the Rule JSON editor and note the structure and syntax of the rule logic. Add an exception statement for the XSS rule to allow access to /reportBuilder/Editor.aspx . Note that we are using the JSON editor here due to the nested logic requred fo rthe exception. After reviewing it, clear the existing editor content for the matchXSS rule and paste the following JSON Nested Statement with XSS Exception Solution { \"Name\": \"matchXSS\", \"Priority\": 2, \"Action\": { \"Block\": {} }, \"VisibilityConfig\": { \"SampledRequestsEnabled\": true, \"CloudWatchMetricsEnabled\": true, \"MetricName\": \"matchXSS\" }, \"Statement\": { \"AndStatement\": { \"Statements\": [{ \"NotStatement\": { \"Statement\": { \"ByteMatchStatement\": { \"SearchString\": \"/reportBuilder/Editor.aspx\", \"FieldToMatch\": { \"UriPath\": {} }, \"TextTransformations\": [{ \"Priority\": 0, \"Type\": \"NONE\" }], \"PositionalConstraint\": \"STARTS_WITH\" } } } }, { \"OrStatement\": { \"Statements\": [{ \"XssMatchStatement\": { \"FieldToMatch\": { \"QueryString\": {} }, \"TextTransformations\": [{ \"Priority\": 0, \"Type\": \"URL_DECODE\" }] } }, { \"XssMatchStatement\": { \"FieldToMatch\": { \"Body\": {} }, \"TextTransformations\": [{ \"Priority\": 0, \"Type\": \"HTML_ENTITY_DECODE\" }, { \"Priority\": 1, \"Type\": \"URL_DECODE\" } ] } }, { \"XssMatchStatement\": { \"FieldToMatch\": { \"SingleHeader\": { \"Name\": \"cookie\" } }, \"TextTransformations\": [{ \"Priority\": 0, \"Type\": \"URL_DECODE\" }] } } ] } } ] } } } Click Save rule Re-run the WAF test script (runscanner) from your red team host to confirm requests are blocked 2. Mitigate File Inclusion & Path Traversal Use the string and regex matching to build rules that block specific patterns indicative of unwanted path traversal or file inclusion. Consider the following: Can end users browse the directory structure of your web folders? Do you have directory indexes enabled? Is your application (or any dependency components) use input parameters in filesystem or remote URL references? Do you adequately lock down access so input paths cannot be manipulated? What considerations do you need to account for in regards to false positives (directory traversal signature patterns)? Build rules that ensure the relevant HTTP request components used for input into paths do not contain known path traversal patterns. Solution Create a new rule named matchTraversal and for If a request choose matches at least one of the statements (OR) . Add statements: uri_path, starts with string, /include , url_decode query_string, contains string, ../ , url_decode query_string, contains string, :// , url_decode Click on Add Rule and then click Save Re-run the WAF test script (runscanner) from your red team host to confirm requests are blocked 3. Enforce Request Hygiene Use the string and regex matching, size constraints and IP address matching to build rules that block non-conforming or low value HTTP requests. Consider the following: \u2022 Are there limits to the size of the various HTTP request components relevant to your web application? For example, does your application ever use URIs that are longer than 100 characters in size? \u2022 Are there specific HTTP request components without which your application cannot operate effectively (e.g. CSRF token header, authorization header, referrer header)? Build rules that ensure the requests your application ends up processing are valid, conforming and valuable. Solution In the left pane, choose Regex pattern sets , Create regex pattern set Regex pattern set name csrf , Regular expressions ^[0-9a-f]{40}$ The Regex pattern above is a simple example that matahes the string length (40) and characters (0-9 or a-f). Copy the Regex pattern set ID into a scratch file to refer to it later. Note your AWS account Id and region and add them to the scratch file. Create a new rule and choose Rule JSON editor Paste the following JSON and update the region, AWS account Id and Regex pattern ID with the one created in the previous step Nested Statement with Request Hygiene Solution { \"Name\": \"matchCSRF\", \"Priority\": 3, \"Action\": { \"Block\": {} }, \"VisibilityConfig\": { \"SampledRequestsEnabled\": true, \"CloudWatchMetricsEnabled\": true, \"MetricName\": \"matchCSRF\" }, \"Statement\": { \"AndStatement\": { \"Statements\": [{ \"NotStatement\": { \"Statement\": { \"RegexPatternSetReferenceStatement\": { \"ARN\": \"arn:aws:wafv2:YOUR_REGION:ACCOUNT_ID:regional/regexpatternset/csrf/YOUR_REGEX_PATTERN_ID\", \"FieldToMatch\": { \"SingleHeader\": { \"Name\": \"x-csrf-token\" } }, \"TextTransformations\": [{ \"Priority\": 0, \"Type\": \"URL_DECODE\" }] } } } }, { \"OrStatement\": { \"Statements\": [{ \"ByteMatchStatement\": { \"SearchString\": \"/form.php\", \"FieldToMatch\": { \"UriPath\": {} }, \"TextTransformations\": [{ \"Priority\": 0, \"Type\": \"NONE\" }], \"PositionalConstraint\": \"STARTS_WITH\" } }, { \"ByteMatchStatement\": { \"SearchString\": \"/form.php\", \"FieldToMatch\": { \"UriPath\": {} }, \"TextTransformations\": [{ \"Priority\": 0, \"Type\": \"NONE\" }], \"PositionalConstraint\": \"EXACTLY\" } } ] } } ] } } } Click Save rule Re-run the WAF test script (runscanner) from your red team host to confirm requests are blocked Attention If you have 30 minutes or less remaining in the workshop, you should consider proceeding to the Host Layer round . There will be time during the Inspector Assessment run to continue the WAF excercises. Note About Remaining Exercises The remaining exercises below are optional. You should proceed to the Verify Phase and come back to the content below if time permits. 4. Limit Attack Footprint (Optional) Use geo matching to build rules that limit the attack footprint against the exposed components of your application. Consider the following: \u2022 Does your web application have server-side include components in the public web path? \u2022 Does your web application have components at exposed paths that are not used (or dependencies have such functions)? \u2022 Do you have administrative, management, status or health check paths and components that aren\u2019t meant for end user access? You should consider blocking access to such elements, or limiting access to known sources, either whitelisted IP addresses or geographic locations. Solution Create a new rule and choose Rule JSON editor Paste the following JSON and update the region and Regex pattern ID with the one created in the previous step Nested Statement with Limit Attack Footprint Solution { \"Name\": \"matchAdminNotAffiliate\", \"Priority\": 4, \"Action\": { \"Block\": {} }, \"VisibilityConfig\": { \"SampledRequestsEnabled\": true, \"CloudWatchMetricsEnabled\": true, \"MetricName\": \"matchAdminNotAffiliate\" }, \"Statement\": { \"AndStatement\": { \"Statements\": [{ \"NotStatement\": { \"Statement\": { \"GeoMatchStatement\": { \"CountryCodes\": [ \"US\", \"RO\" ] } } } }, { \"ByteMatchStatement\": { \"FieldToMatch\": { \"UriPath\": {} }, \"PositionalConstraint\": \"STARTS_WITH\", \"SearchString\": \"/admin\", \"TextTransformations\": [{ \"Type\": \"NONE\", \"Priority\": 0 }] } } ] } } } Click on Add Rule and then click Save 5. Detect & Mitigate Anomalies (Optional) What constitutes an anomaly in regards to your web application? A few common anomaly patterns are: Unusually elevated volume of requests in general Unusually elevated volumes of requests to specific URI paths Unusually elevated levels of requests generating specific non-HTTP status 200 responses Unusually elevated volumes from certain sources (IPs, geographies) Usual request signatures (referrers, user agent strings, content types, etc) Do you have mechanisms in place to detect such patterns? If so, can you build rules to mitigate them? Solution Create a new rule named matchRateLogin of type Rate-based rule Rate limit 1000 choose Only consider requests that match the criteria in a rule statement choose If a request choose matches at least one of the statements (OR) . Add statements: uri_path, starts with string, /login.php http_method, exactly matches string, POST text transformation, None Click on Add Rule and then click Save 6. Reputation Lists, Nuisance Requests (Optional) Reputation lists (whitelists or blacklists) are a good way to filter and stop servicing low value requests. This can reduce operating costs, and reduce exposure to attack vectors. Reputation lists can be self-maintained: lists of identifiable actors that you have determined are undesired. They can be identified any number of ways: the source IP address the user agent string reuse of hijacked authorization or session tokens, attempting to make requests to paths that clearly do not exist in your application but are well known vulnerable software packages (probing) Build blacklists of such actors using the relevant statements and set up rules to match and block them. An example IP-based blacklist already exists in your sandbox environment. Reputation lists can also be maintained by third parties.

Viewing and Logging Requests In the Overview tab for your Web ACL, you can view a sample of the requests that have been inspected by the WAF. For each sampled request, you can view detailed data about the request, such as the originating IP address and the headers included in the request. You also can view which rule the request matched, and whether the rule is configured to allow or block requests. You can refer to the sampled requests throughout this exercise to monitor activity and look for suspicious activity.

Web ACLs \u2013 You use a web access control list (ACL) to protect a set of AWS resources. You create a web ACL and define its protection strategy by adding rules. Rules define criteria for inspecting web requests and specify how to handle requests that match the criteria. You set a default action for the web ACL that indicates whether to block or allow through those requests that pass the rules inspections. Rules \u2013 Each rule contains a statement that defines the inspection criteria, and an action to take if a web request meets the criteria. When a web request meets the criteria, that's a match. You can use rules to block matching requests or to allow matching requests through. You can also use rules just to count matching requests. Rules groups \u2013 You can use rules individually or in reusable rule groups. AWS Managed Rules and AWS Marketplace sellers provide managed rule groups for your use. You can also define your own rule groups. Rule statements are the part of a rule that tells AWS WAF how to inspect a web request. When AWS WAF finds the inspection criteria in a web request, we say that the web request matches the statement. Every rule statement specifies what to look for and how, according to the statement type. Every rule in AWS WAF has a single top-level rule statement, which can contain other statements. Rule statements can be very simple. For example, you could have a statement that provides just a set of originating countries to check your web requests for. Rule statements can also be very complex. For example, you could have a statement that combines many other statements with logical AND, OR, and NOT statements.","title":"Basics"},{"location":"workshop/perimeter-layer/remediate/#how-waf-works","text":"After you create your web ACL, you can associate it with one or more AWS resources.

Consider the following: How does your web application accept end-user input (whether directly or indirectly). Which HTTP request components does that input get inserted into? What kind of content encoding considerations do you need to factor in for the input format? What considerations do you need to account for in regards to false positives? For example, does your application legitimately need to accept SQL statements as input? How do the requirements derived from the above questions affect your solution? SQL Injection Solution Update the matchSQLi rule with 2 additional statements Select the matchSQLi rule and click Edit ( You should have created this rule in the walk through above ) Change If a request to matches at least one of the statements (OR) Click Add another statement : body, contains sql injection attacks, html entity decode and URL decode Click Add another statement : header, cookie, contains sql injection attacks, url decode View the existing matchSQLi rule to confirm additional condtions Re-run the WAF test script (runscanner) from your red team host to confirm requests are blocked Rule JSON editor Thus far you have used the Visual Rule Editor to create WAF Rules but every web ACL also has a JSON format representation. In there, you see these special types of rule statements. For rules of any complexity, managing your web ACL using the JSON editor is the easiest way to go. You can retrieve the complete configuration for a web ACL in JSON format, modify it as you need, and then provide it through the console, API, or CLI. AWS WAF supports nesting of rule statements. To combine rule statement results, you nest the statements under logical AND or OR rule statements. The visual editor on the console supports one level of rule statement nesting, which works for many needs. To nest more levels, you can edit the JSON representation of the rule on the console. Cross Site Scripting Solution Create a new rule named matchXSS and for If a request choose matches at least one of the statements (OR) .
